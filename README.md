# EAD and DACS 

**E**ncoded **A**rchival **D**escription is a standard to create machine-readable archival finding aids in XML format.
**D**escribing **A**rchives: A **C**ontent **S**tandard is a format-neutral descriptive standard to guide archival description. It has been the official content standard of the U.S. archivist community since it was adopted by the Society of American Archivists in 2005. And it lives on [GitHub](https://saa-ts-dacs.github.io/dacs/)!
